## Hi there , I'm Phostomy St Ilbert - aka Tommy ðŸ‘‹.
Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student in Software Engineering with a growing passion for building and improving digital solutions.
I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, VS Code, and Figma, which allows me to contribute both to the technical and design aspects of projects.

I enjoy tackling challenges, especially debugging and problem-solving, where I can find errors and create efficient solutions.
Outside of tech, I like to read and play basketballâ€”activities that help me stay creative, focused, and collaborative.

Iâ€™m eager to keep learning, contribute to real-world projects, and grow into a well-rounded software engineer
